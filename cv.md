## About Me
I have been engaged in sales and customer management all my working life. 

Since 2023 I decided to change the vector of my development. 

I successfully completed course of automation QA in Red Rover School in 2024.

Now I'm tickled pink with the idea of being a web-developer.

I've also been leading English club as a voluntere teacher, we meet twice a week online.

I love my team and I love teaching them.

I'm also running some projects as a PM and as a tester.
